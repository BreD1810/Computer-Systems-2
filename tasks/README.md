# Tasks

These are the tasks set within the module, totalling to 20% of the module.

# Instructions for all Tasks

Typically you will be provided with skeleton code and your solution can be a modified version of the skeletoncode.  You are free to discard the skeleton code and write a solution from scratch, but your are expected tounderstand the skeleton code.  You should spent 2–3 h on a task.  It is expected that you can not solve some ofthe tasks within this time.  However, engaging with the challenge set for the indicated time should achieve theintended learning outcome.  Please always comment your code so that it could be used and modified by anotherstudent that is very familiar with C and and the AT90USB1286 controller.

You are expected to make a first attempt to solve the task on your own within the first two days of the taskbeing published.  If you run into difficulties (after spending maybe a concentrated hour on it) you are welcome toask your peers, ask on the student wiki page, and ask for help during the tutorial session.

Subsequent tasks will build on preceding ones—expect the overall challenge to increase over the course of themodule.  Make every effort to fully understand the material covered in a task.  If something is unclear, do nothesitate to ask at any time even about earlier tasks.  The learning outcomes listed with each tasks are describedin the [Syllabus](https://syllabus.soton.ac.uk/view/syllabus/1963).
