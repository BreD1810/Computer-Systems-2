Task 7: LaFortuna Project 1
--
The aim for the remaining time of the module is to build either a library or an application for the LaFortuna. This coursework is spread over two tasks, each of which is worth 4 marks:  designing and implementing your library or application (Task 7) and refining and documenting your library or application (Task 8).

You can choose freely what you would like to implementâ€”take into account, however, how much time you have available next to your other obligations.

If you do not have an idea what to build already, maybe one of the following suggestions can help:
* Think of something related to your hobbies.
* Look back at games and software for the computers of the early 80s.
* Adapt an existing AVR-, Arduino-, or other C- project for the LaFortuna.
  * Maybe adapt the PacMan C++ code available, e.g. a Font library, or a Sprite library for games.
* Think of how the LaFortuna could a become useful device for you after the module is over.
* Take a look at the projects from previous years linked on the wiki.

## Extra Work
There will be a competition for the honour of "best project in the category embedded library" and the "best project in the category embedded application". To compete for this, you will need to:
* Make your code available in a repository accessible to future students of COMP2215 (e.g. GitHub)
* Document the project such that it can be used by others.
* Make a Wiki entry for the project, advertising and explaining your project (e.g. functionality, screenshots).
